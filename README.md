# Interactive presentations with R

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/82212447.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/82212447)

[*A code-along lesson for the CERN Study Group*](https://github.com/CERNStudyGroup/cernstudygroup.github.io/issues/46)

You can view the presentation here: [https://via.hypothes.is/https://raoofphysics.github.io/201702_R-presentations/](https://via.hypothes.is/https://raoofphysics.github.io/201702_R-presentations/)

The slides should also be available on a mobile browser, although Firefox isn't loading the interactive plots for some reason. Against my better judgement, I recommend you use Chrome on Android to view the content.

If you use hypothes.is, please annotate the presentation! I will be grateful for any notes you leave.

## Build information

This presentation is put together using:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/), using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
- [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) + [plotly](https://plot.ly/) for the bar plots
- [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html) (available within RStudio) + [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) for the presentation itself
- [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/), which provides the annotation layer on top of the presentation

knitr takes the `.Rmd` (R Markdown) file and through some wizardry produces a standalone `.html` file that serves as the presentation.
